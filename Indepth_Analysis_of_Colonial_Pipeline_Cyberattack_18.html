<div class='page'><h1 class='title'>Indepth Analysis of Colonial Pipeline Cyberattack</h1><br/><p>Analysis of the Colonial Pipeline Ransomware attack </p><p>The colonial pipeline ransomware attack that occurred on the 7<sup>th</sup> of May 2021 was the largest cyberattack on an oil infrastructure in the history of the United States. </p><p>The colonial pipeline which controls nearly fifty percent of  the gasoline, jet fuel and diesel had to shut down their 5,500-mile pipeline delivering fuel from Gulf coast refineries to major East coast markets due to a ransomware attack.  It did so out of concern that the malware that had infected its back-office functions could make it difficult to bill for fuel delivered along the pipeline or even spread into the pipeline’s operating system. </p><p>Cybersecurity experts also note that Colonial Pipeline would never have had to shut down its pipeline if it had more confidence in the separation between its business network and pipeline operations.</p><p>This led to a spike in gasoline prices, panic buying and localized fuel shortages.</p><p>Causes</p><p>The attack occurred using a legacy Virtual Private Network VPN that did not have Multi-Factor Authentication MFA in place that means with only a username and password the attacker gained access to the system</p><p>Lack of separation between data management and the actual operational technology</p><p>Recommendations</p><p>Authentication is a method of verifying that you are the legitimate owner of an account. There are three methods of authentication </p><p>1. Something you know – By remembering a piece of information and inputting it you can prove that you are who you say are. Examples:  Passwords, Passphrases and PIN</p><p>2. Something you have – By possessing something you can prove that you are a given entity Examples: Token, memory cards, passcode grid</p><p>3. Something you are – Presenting a unique attribute tied to your physical make up Biometrics- Palm vein scan, thumbprints, facial recognition and retina</p><p>Using only one of the methods of authentication is single-factor authentication and granting users access only after successfully demonstrating or displaying two or more of these methods is known as multi-factor authentication (MFA).</p><p>Proper network segmentation using layers of defense. It is good practice to ensure that any system with sensitive data must reside on the private(internal) network and must NOT be accessible from the public network - the internet</p><p>References</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonial_Pipeline_ransomware_attack">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonial_Pipeline_ransomware_attack</a></p><p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-04/hackers-breached-colonial-pipeline-using-compromised-password">https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-04/hackers-breached-colonial-pipeline-using-compromised-password</a></p><p><a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/colonial-pipeline-ceo-tells-senate-cyber-defenses-were-compromised-ahead-hack-2021-06-08/">https://www.reuters.com/business/colonial-pipeline-ceo-tells-senate-cyber-defenses-were-compromised-ahead-hack-2021-06-08/</a></p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/14/us/politics/pipeline-hack.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/14/us/politics/pipeline-hack.html</a></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p></div>
